The modern Data Warehouse requires a few key features, outlined below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nScalability: Data Warehouses become increasingly complex and difficult to manage as the organization grows and more data sources are added. A Data Vault 2.0 approach provides a scalable architecture that can handle large volumes of data from multiple sources. \\r\\n\\r\\nIntegration: Point-to-point data pipelines often require custom integrations for each data source, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. A Data Vault 2.0 approach can provide a standardized method of integrating data from multiple sources, reducing the risk of errors, improving efficiency, and ultimately providing a single source of truth for your data. \\r\\n\\r\\nGovernance: Legacy solutions can result in data silos and a lack of visibility into data lineage, making it difficult to ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. A Data Warehouse following the Data Vault 2.0 approach can provide a centralized and fully audited repository of data, enabling the business to implement better governance and control over data access in less time and following industry standards. \\r\\n\\r\\nData Vault 2.0 is an agile data warehousing methodology, that can help organizations achieve these benefits by providing a highly scalable and adaptable data model that can accommodate changing business requirements and evolving data sources. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo be truly agile, organizations need a data platform that can support rapid development and iteration of data-driven applications and analytics.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAutomateDV is a dbt package that provides a set of macros for implementing a Data Vault 2.0 compliant data warehouse. By automating Data Vault using dbt and AutomateDV (formerly known as dbtvault), data teams can take advantage of the scalability, flexibility, and agility that Data Vault offers while also ensuring that the implementation is maintainable and consistent.   \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nBenefits include: \\r\\n\\r\\nModular and maintainable: dbt provides a modular approach to building data pipelines, allowing data teams to break down complex data transformations into smaller, more manageable components. With AutomateDV, teams can implement Data Vault using provided macros, making it easier to maintain and update the implementation over time, allowing engineers to focus on delivering business value.  \\r\\n\\r\\nConsistency and scalability: With dbt and AutomateDV, data teams can ensure that the Data Vault implementation is consistent across different environments, such as development, staging, and production. This consistency helps to reduce errors and ensures that the implementation can scale as the data volume and complexity grows. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetter collaboration: By using dbt and AutomateDV, data teams can collaborate more effectively, as the implementation is defined in code and version controlled. This approach allows different team members to work on different parts of the implementation simultaneously, while also providing a clear audit trail of changes. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nOverall, automating Data Vault using dbt and AutomateDV can help data teams to build a scalable, flexible, and maintainable data platform that can meet the needs of a growing organization. &quot;}\">&nbsp;</span><br><br><span data-sheets-formula=\"=Sessions!R[-53]C[5]\" data-sheets-userformat='{\"2\":256,\"11\":4}' data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Data Vault 2.0 Methodology and Architecture for Data Warehousing is not new; however, it is uncommon, and often unheard of.

This approach allows different team members to work on different parts of the implementation simultaneously, while also providing a clear audit trail of changes. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nOverall, automating Data Vault using dbt and AutomateDV can help data teams to build a scalable, flexible, and maintainable data platform that can meet the needs of a growing organization. &quot;}\"><span data-sheets-formula=\"=Sessions!R[-43]C[5]\" data-sheets-userformat='{\"2\":256,\"11\":4}' data-sheets-value='{\"1\":2,\"2\":\"Over the past four years, the data team at EQT has leveraged dbt and Snowflake to create a myriad of data products across the company.

The process also helped software engineers to own their own data and realize their impact.

      "description": "The Guild team migrated to Snowflake and dbt for their data warehousing needs and immediately saw the benefits of standardizing model structure, DRYer logic, data lineage ,and automated testing on Pull Requests.\n\nBut leveraging dbt didn’t solve everything. Pain points around maintaining model logic, handling historical data, and integrating data from over 60 source systems meant that analysts still struggled to provide a unified view of the business. The team knew that they needed to level up their processes and modeling again, and chose to adopt Data Vault (DV).\n\nBrandon and Rebecca will take you behind the scenes of this decision to explain the benefits of Data Vault. They will highlight DV’s ability to handle complex data integration requirements while remaining agile and demonstrate that it complements other modern data concepts like domain-driven design and data mesh.\n\nAttendees will learn what Data Vault is, when it can be a key component of a successful data strategy, and instances where it’s not the right fit. They will walk away with practical tips to successfully transition based on a real-world implementation.\n\nGuild transformed their data warehouse; you can too!",
      "descriptionHtml": "<p>The Guild team migrated to Snowflake and dbt for their data warehousing needs and immediately saw the benefits of standardizing model structure, DRYer logic, data lineage ,and automated testing on Pull Requests.</p><p>But leveraging dbt didn’t solve everything. Pain points around maintaining model logic, handling historical data, and integrating data from over 60 source systems meant that analysts still struggled to provide a unified view of the business. The team knew that they needed to level up their processes and modeling again, and chose to adopt Data Vault (DV).</p><p>Brandon and Rebecca will take you behind the scenes of this decision to explain the benefits of Data Vault. They will highlight DV’s ability to handle complex data integration requirements while remaining agile and demonstrate that it complements other modern data concepts like domain-driven design and data mesh.</p><p>Attendees will learn what Data Vault is, when it can be a key component of a successful data strategy, and instances where it’s not the right fit.

Analytics engineers translate impossibly complex business semantics into precise frameworks that give modern companies digital eyes and ears, making them the most agile and responsive organizations ever created. Data scientists find revolutionary truths among vast expanses of noise and distraction, unearthing tiny diamonds in endless mines of numerical dirt. <br><br>This talk isn’t about any of that.<br><br>This talk is about commas. It’s about capitalization. It’s about indentation. It’s about the tedious arguments that no sensible person should ever care about, but we, as data people, can’t seem to resist. It’s about indulging in our unhinged debates, analyzing data on billions of queries, and giving us all a reason to bury our flag a bit deeper into whatever petty hill we’ve each chosen to die on. Let the good times roll. &nbsp;<br><br>Will it tell us anything useful? No. Will there be slides that you can take pictures of to show your leadership team why your role is valuable? Absolutely not. But there will be lots of charts<br>, graphs<br>, and misplaced commas.",
